  An indicator from Best Buy as to whether an amount was paid at the time of purchase (value: 0)
  or if nothing was paid (value: 1) at the time of purchase. At launch this was not initially populated
  and then for an initial promotional period (planned to be through the end of December 2020) the value
  of 1 indicates a free first month during this period. Additional fields and price types are planned
  to be added later.
